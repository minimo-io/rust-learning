// Let's consider the case

// this patter of propagation is so common in Ruest 
// that we have the question mark ? operator to handle them.

// let's implement a funtion read_username_from_file but
// with the ? operator
fn read_username_from_file_2() -> Result<String, io::Error>{
    let mut username_from_file = File::open("username.txt")?;
    // the ? means that if the result is Ok() then Ok(file) will be returned
    // and if it fails then Err(error) will be returned **from the whole function** (like ending with return X)
    // but in this case the error type will the then one of the return type of the
    // current function.

    let mut username = String::new();
    username_from_file.read_to_string(&mut username)?;
    Ok(username)

// this function opens the file, creates a new String, reads the content
// put the content into a string and returns it.
use std::fs;
fn read_username_from_file_4(filepath: String)-> Result<String, io::Error>{

// We can also use the question mark operator in an Option<T> value
// And the same as with Result, WE CAN ONLY USE ? ON OPTION, IN A FUNCTION
// THAT ALSO RETURNS AN OPTION (That is why at the end of main() i could not return ?)
// since main() has a return type of ()


// When failure is expected, itâ€™s more appropriate to return a Result than to make a panic! call.
